A declarative router for [ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift). Allows developers to declare routes in a similar manner as URLs are used on the web.

Using ReSwiftRouter you can navigate your app by defining the target location in the form of a URL-like sequence of identifiers:

```swift
mainStore.dispatch(
    SetRouteAction(["TabBarViewController", StatsViewController.identifier])
)
```

# About ReSwiftRouter

**ReSwiftRouter is still under development and the API is neither complete nor stable at this point.**

When building apps with ReSwift you should aim to cause **all** state changes through actions - this includes changes to the navigation state.

This requires to store the current navigation state within the app state and to use actions to trigger changes to that state - both is provided ReSwiftRouter.

# Installation


## CocoaPods

You can install ReSwiftRouter via CocoaPods by adding it to your `Podfile`:

	use_frameworks!

	source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
	platform :ios, '8.0'
	
	pod 'ReSwift'
	pod 'ReSwiftRouter'

And run `pod install`.

## Carthage

You can install ReSwiftRouter via [Carthage]() by adding the following line to your Cartfile:

	github "ReSwift/ReSwift-Router"

# Configuration

Extend your app state to include the navigation state:

```swift
import ReSwiftRouter

struct AppState: StateType {
    // other application state
    var navigationState: NavigationState
}
```

After you've initialized your store, create an instance of `Router`, passing in a reference to the store and to the root `Routable`. Additionally you will need to provide a closure that describes how to access the `navigationState` of your application state:

```swift
router = Router(store: mainStore, rootRoutable: RootRoutable(routable: rootViewController)) { state in 
	state.select { $0.navigationState }
}
```

We'll discuss `Routable` in the next main section.

## Calling the Navigation Reducer

The `NavigationReducer` is provided as part of `ReSwiftRouter`. You need to call it from within your top-level reducer. Here's a simple example from the specs:

```swift
struct AppReducer: Reducer {
    func handleAction(action: Action, state: FakeAppState?) -> FakeAppState {
        return FakeAppState(
            navigationState: NavigationReducer.handleAction(action, state: state?.navigationState)
        )
    }
}
```
This will make reducer handle all routing relevant actions.

# Implementing `Routable`

ReSwiftRouter works with routes that are defined, similar to URLs, as a sequence of elements e.g. `["Home", "User", "UserDetail"]`. 

ReSwiftRouter is agnostic of the UI framework you are using - it uses `Routable`s to implement that interaction.

Each route element is mapped to one responsible `Routable`. The `Routable` needs to be able to present a child, hide a child or replace a child with another child.

Here is the `Routable` protocol with the methods you should implement:

```swift

public protocol Routable {

    func push(
        _ element: RouteElement,
        animated: Bool,
        completion: @escaping RoutingCompletion) -> Routable

    func pop(
        _ element: RouteElement,
        animated: Bool,
        completion: @escaping RoutingCompletion)

    func change(
        _ from: RouteElement,
        to: RouteElement,
        animated: Bool,
        completion: @escaping RoutingCompletion) -> Routable

}

```

As part of initializing `Router` you need to pass the first `Routable` as an argument. That root `Routable` will be responsible for the first route element.

If e.g. you set the route of your application to `["Home"]`, your root `Routable` will be asked to present the view that corresponds to the element `"Home"`. 

When working on iOS with UIKit this would mean the `Routable` would need to set the `rootViewController` of the application.  

Whenever a `Routable` presents a new route element, it needs to return a new `Routable` that will be responsible for managing the presented element. If you want to navigate from `["Home"]` to `["Home", "Users"]` the `Routable` responsible for the `"Home"` element will be asked to present the `"User"` element.

If your navigation stack uses a modal presentation for this transition, the implementation of `Routable` for the `"Home"` element might look like this:

```swift
func push(_ element: RouteElement, animated: Bool, completion: @escaping RoutingCompletion) -> Routable {

	if element == "User" {
		// 1.) Perform the transition
        userViewController = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
            .instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("UserViewController") as! Routable

		// 2.) Call the `completion` once the transition is complete
        presentViewController(userViewController, animated: false,
            completion: completion)

		// 3.) Return the Routable for the presented element. For convenience
		// this will often be the UIViewController itself. 
        return userViewController
   	}
   	
   	// ...
}

func pop(_ element: RouteElement, animated: Bool, completion: @escaping RoutingCompletion)

	if element == "Home" {
    	dismissViewControllerAnimated(false, completion: completion)
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

## Calling the Completion Handler within Routables

ReSwiftRouter needs to throttle the navigation actions, since many UI frameworks including UIKit don't allow to perform multiple navigation steps in parallel. Therefor every method of `Routable` receives a `completion` handler. The router will not perform any further navigation actions until the completion handler is called.

# Changing the Current Route

Currently the only way to change the current application route is by using the `SetRouteAction` and providing an absolute route. Here's a brief example:

```swift
@IBAction func cancelButtonTapped(sender: UIButton) {
    mainStore.dispatch(
        SetRouteAction(["TabBarViewController", StatsViewController.identifier])
    )
}
```
As development continues, support for changing individual route elements will be added.

## Compiling & Running tests

ReSwiftRouter uses [Carthage]() for its development dependencies. To build or test any of the targets, run `carthage bootstrap`.

/** 
 The Navigation Reducer handles the state slice concerned with storing the current navigation
 information. Note, that this reducer is **not** a *top-level* reducer, you need to use it within
 another reducer and pass in the relevant state slice. Take a look at the specs to see an
 example set up.
